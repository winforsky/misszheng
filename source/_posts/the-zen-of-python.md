The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.[优美优于丑陋]
Explicit is better than implicit.[显式优于隐式]
Simple is better than complex.[简单优于复杂]
Complex is better than complicated.[复杂优于难懂]
Flat is better than nested.[扁平优于嵌套]
Sparse is better than dense.[稀疏优于紧密]
Readability counts.[重视可读性]
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.[特例也不能特例打破规则]
Although practicality beats purity.[尽管实用性打败纯粹性]
Errors should never pass silently.[不应忽视错误]
Unless explicitly silenced.[除非显式声明]
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.[面对不确定的定义，拒绝盲目猜测]
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.[应该找到一种且最好只有唯一的一种处理方法来明确处理它]
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.[尽管一开始这种处理方法并不显而易见，除非你是Python之父Dutch]
Now is better than never.[现在做好于永远不做]
Although never is often better than *right* now.[但不想就做还不如不做，重点在强调right，把事情做对]
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.[如果解决方案很难解释，说明它是一个不好的方案]
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.[如果方案很容易解释，说明它是一个不错的方案]
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those![命名空间是个超级棒的方法，让我们多多使用它]
